      Hiya! ðŸ‘‹ <br /><br />
      Iâ€™m a software engineer with experience in UX research. <br /><br />My
      interest in coding began after participating in a workshop where I used a
      language called Littlefoot to make music on the Lightpad Block. I was
      blown away by the possibility of creating interfaces that make human
      interaction with technology fun. <br /><br />Recently, I finished the
      Software Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly, where I trained
      as a Full-Stack developer. You can check out my GitHub or just play tetris
      (made by me!). <br /><br />If you are interested in hiring me, youâ€™ll be
      pleased to hear that Iâ€™m collaborative team-member who loves to share and
      is open to learning. Iâ€™m looking to progress my career in the tech
      industry as a developer.
