    <p>
      Iâ€™m a software engineer with experience in UX Research and Music
      Technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      I decided to learn how to code after participating in a workshop where I
      used a language called Littlefoot to make music on the Lightpad Block.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was blown away by the possibility of creating interfaces that make human
      interaction with technology fun and couldn't stop myself from exploring
      further.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recently, I finished the Software Engineering Immersive course at General
      Assembly, where I trained as a Full-Stack Engineer
    </p>

    <p>
      I am now looking for my first role as a developer I am now looking to work
      as a developer in a collaborative team where I can share my creativity and
      learn from others.
