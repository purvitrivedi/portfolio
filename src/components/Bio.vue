    <p>
      Iâ€™m a software engineer with experience in UX Research and Music
      Technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      I decided to learn how to code after participating in a workshop where I
      used a language called Littlefoot to make music on the Lightpad Block.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was blown away by the possibility of creating interfaces that make human
      interaction with technology fun and couldn't stop myself from exploring
      further.
    </p>
    <p>
      I completed the Software Engineering Immersive course at General
      Assembly, where I trained as a Full-Stack Engineer.

    <p>
      Currently, I work as a Fullstack developer at <a href="https://p.ota.to/" target="_blank">Potato.</a>
